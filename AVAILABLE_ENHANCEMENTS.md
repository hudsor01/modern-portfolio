## Getting Started

To implement any of these enhancements:

1. **Choose a feature** from the list above
2. **Check the existing architecture** in:
   - `/src/lib/atoms/` for Jotai state
   - `/src/server/rpc/` for API endpoints
   - `/src/hooks/` for React Query setup

3. **Follow the patterns** established in:
   - `/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for implementation patterns
   - `/src/lib/atoms/IMPLEMENTATION.md` for Jotai patterns
   - `/src/server/rpc/README.md` for RPC patterns

4. **Test thoroughly** using:
   - Unit tests for atoms
   - Integration tests for RPC
   - E2E tests for user flows

Each enhancement leverages the installed packages (Jotai, Hono, React Query) to provide better performance, type safety, and developer experience than traditional implementations.
