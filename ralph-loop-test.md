# Ralph Loop Test Log

## Purpose
Testing the Ralph loop plugin to verify it correctly:
- Iterates through multiple cycles
- Preserves state between iterations
- Stops at max iterations (5 in this test)

---

## Iteration 1

**Time**: Starting test
**Action**: Created this tracking file
**Observations**:
- Ralph loop activated successfully
- Max iterations set to 5
- No completion promise (will run until max iterations)

**Next Iteration Goals**:
- Verify this file persists
- Add more test data
- Check iteration counter increments
